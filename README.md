iOS application to check in your visitors with tickets generated by [pretix](https://pretix.eu).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdelete/pretixios.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdelete/pretixios)

Project status
--------------

This project is work-in-progess. It uses the new *Pretix* API not the deprecated *Prextidroid* API for connecting with the pretix portal. 

Features that work:

* Connecting the app to a pretix installation for a specific checkin list of an event
* Scanning and validating tickets simultaneously on multiple devices
* Manually browsing for an attendee, viewing details and manual check in
* Limited support for usage without an internet connection

Caveats:

* You need an internet connection to validate and check people in

Configuration
-------------

Like with [pretixdroid](https://github.com/pretix/pretixdroid/) the app is configured using a QR-Code, however it is currently not usable with the orginal config code from the pretix portal.

We are working on this with pretix but for the time beeing, you need to create the code by yourself using the following JSON-string and filling out the blanks:

    {"version": 5, "allow_search": true, "show_info": true, "apikey": "PRETIX API KEY _NOT_ PRETIXDROID", apiurl: "https://pretix.eu/api/v1/organizers/ORGIANIZER/events/THEEVENT", checkin_list: INT}

Next features
-------------

* A lot of cleanup and fixes
* Full offline support
* Badge printing using AirPrint
